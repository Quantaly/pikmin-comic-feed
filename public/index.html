      <h1>Pikmin comic feed</h1>
      <p>
        Nintendo publishes a delightful webcomic drawn by Kino Takahashi based
        on the world and characters of Pikmin 4. While the comic is great (and
        so is the game!), having to check their website for updates is annoying,
        so I created an Atom feed for it. You can subscribe to it with whatever
        feed reader app you already use.
