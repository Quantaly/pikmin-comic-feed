# Pikmin comic feed

Nintendo publishes a delightful webcomic drawn by Kino Takahashi based on the world and characters of Pikmin 4. While the comic is great (and so is the game!), having to check their website for updates is annoying, so I created an Atom feed for it. You can subscribe to it with whatever feed reader app you already use.
